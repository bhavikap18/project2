	<h2>About Sausalito </h2>
	<font color="#DFC3F9"> Sausalito is the neighboring city to San Francisco. The city has a population of barely 8,000 people. Many residents own houseboats and enjoy fishing along the city's coast line. Itâ€™s known for its Richardson Bay houseboat enclaves, built by artist squatters after WWII. Similar to San Francisco, the city's architechture reflects it's quaint history. The steep hills are home to many residents. The city is located on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge.  </font>
